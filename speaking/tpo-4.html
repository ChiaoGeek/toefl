In the lecture, the professor talks about entertainment merchandising which is a
form of marketing in which the brand or image from one product is also used to
sell another. In the first example, the professor talks about a character called
the Action Hero, when he was a kid, the TV show was very popular, so when he and
his friends saw little Action Hero figures in the stores, they all had to buy them.
And he talks about his daughter in the second example, her favorite toy is a doll
called Rosa, she and her friends play with the doll all the time. Not long ago,
the kids discovered that there will be a new TV program which is about Rosa. She

The professor talks about establishing shot in the lecture which is a shot used
to provide context for the rest of the scene. And he uses a new movie as an
example. In one scene, before the action and talking started, an image of a
city is shown to the audience to provide context. Things in the city looked
old fashioned, and the city itself was gloomy and dark. And it was raining too,
and kind of foggy, all these elements worked together to create a mysterious
feeling. So when the action started, the audience would get the idea that the
story of the movie takes place in a big city during the 1940s, and the rest of
the movie will be very mysterious and dark.
