In the lecture, the professor talks about babies can feel concern for others, to
have empathy for others. She gives us a experiment to demonstrate her point. In
the first part of experiment, they played a tape of babies crying to a baby, sure
enough the baby heard the tape and started crying, the researcher assumed that the
baby cried because of the noise. And then the researchers played the baby a tape
of his own crying, the baby didn’t cry despite the noise. In fact, the noise had
nothing to do with it. It cried in the first part not because of the noise, but it
got upset because it felt empathy, concern for others.

In the lecture, the professor talks about the two ways plants protect them from
being eaten by insects. The first is that they use physical features that make
it hard for insects to land on them. Passion plants have spiky hairs all over them,
no room is left for insects to land on the leaves in order eat them. The second kind
of defense is chemical. Take the potato plant for example, it can release a chemical
from its leaf system when being eaten by insects. The insect swallows this chemical
which makes it feel full, like it’s already had enough to eat. Because the insect
doesn’t feel hungry any longer, it stops eating the plant.
