  1、When the government cuts the economic crisis
  　　1.Art 2.Scientific research 3.Parks and public gardens
  　　What do you think is more important？

      I think parks and public gardens is more important when the government cuts the economic crisis.
      Firstly, funding for parks and public gardens provides an opportunity for people to engage in physical activities,
      which is considerably beneficial to health. Nowadays, due to the sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating diet,
      overweight and obesity are epidemic problems across the world. A primary focus of attention is providing the environment
      where people can be physically active.
      Admittedly, developing art and scientific research is important to the country. However, in the times of crisis,
      people usually lay emphasis on basic needs instead of spiritual needs. As a result, the importance of material
      comforts overweights that of nourishment for the mind.

　　2、Do you agree or disagree with the following statement？
      Taking care of pets brings important benefits to a child.

      I think that pet raising is beneficial to a child for the following reasons.
      Firstly, by taking care of pets, children would realise how to maintain the responsibility.
      He or she needs to commit a series of complicated duties, including learning about habitual
      nature of the pet, preparing for the suitable amount of food to feed it in time, doing the cleaning
      and even playing with it.
      Secondly, pet raising enables the children to experience the happiness of being devoted to others.
      Pets are very cute. Although pet raising can waste some time, it will provide the children with a sense
      of achievement. By playing with the pet, he or she can get a lot of fun.

　　3、Do you agree or disagree with the following statement？
      While parents have the responsibility to educate young people about healthy eating habits,
      schools should also be responsible for this.

      I think schools should also be responsible for educating young people about healthy eating habits for the
      following reasons.

      Firstly, most schools have the dining hall, which provides students with food. That's to say. Schools have the
      responsibility for reminding students of paying more attention to healthy eating habits.

      Secondly, schools can provide young people with more professional guidelines on how to foster healthy eating habits.
      Schools have the ability to do more research about health education. These guidelines are based on theory and practice.

　　4、Some people think it would help students to learn if teachers give time for discussion in class,
      others think that class discussion is unnecessary.
      What is your opinion and why.

      Personally, I would say the best way to learn is to participate in class discussion, to begin with, students need to do
      lots of search and prepare notes for the class discussion. They can learn a lot by actively preparing for this. Additionally,
      the whole class gets a chance to hear multiple points of view, although some points might not be as thought-provoking, you can
      learn a lot of stuff beyond the textbooks anyway, and understand how an idea works in real life when people share their personal
      experiences.

　　5、Do you agree or disagree？
      People in the past are more interested in improving their neighborhood (the area where they live) than now.
      Firstly, the limited spare time owned by the people today dampers their passion for improving the community. Nowadays, people have
      devoted most of their time to their work in order to stand out in the fierce competition.
      Secondly, The ties among members of the community become more estranged, which make people nowadays less interested in bettering the
      neighborhood. With the accelerating urbanization,  the population movement has become more frequent than ever before out of various purposes,
      job opportunity, higher education.

Which kind of extracurricular activity would you like to attend if you have a chance: writing essays for students’ newspaper, joining a hiking club or working in the dormitory discipline committee?
　　Personally, I would like to join a hiking club. First off, if I hike in the mountains, I can get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and escape from the concrete jungles, busy street and the crowd. I can get close to mother nature, so I can keep myself refreshed. At the same time, I get a chance to breath fresh air and enjoy the breeze out in the wild. Additionally, one can do other interesting activities outdoors, like go fishing, setting up a camp fire and stuff like that. Hiking club can help me to
   bond with friends and people who have the same interest and hobby.

If our economy
If our enviroment has problems, our economy  will be affected




Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: protecting the environment is just as important as
developing the economy? Explain why. Please include details and examples in your explanation.

Personally, I think that protecting the environment is just as important as developing the economy
because without a sustainable [sə'steɪnəbl]	 environment, our economy will suffer too. For example, we can see right now that
burning the forests in Indonesia is not only destroying the environment, but also hurting the economy. The air in
Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia is so bad right now that many people can't go outside and certain parts of the
economy like farming and construction are completely shut down. No matter how beneficial a business practice is
for the economy, if people can’t eat or work then it's a problem. Therefore，I believe there can be no stable
economy without a stable environment.

 Do you agree or disagree people will read fewer in the future?
 I agree with the statement that people may read less in the future for the following reasons. First,
with .he widespread of internet in recent years, people's preference of media has changed pretty
dramatically. For example, more and more of us mainly get our news through online video clips
and news photographs. Fewer people have the patience to read through long articles. Second, we
now have better ways to enjoy books. Some of them get to be made to movies. And for those that
didn't, we can get audiobooks and listen to them being read to us instead of actually rending them.

如果你的 friend 要准备一个 presentation，你有什么建议 recommend 给他？
属于新题
1.do more practice in the front of mirro   practice makes perfect
2.dont put more words on the each slide
use fewer words and  more pictures too
If my friend is going to do a presentation, I would like to give him the following suggestions. First,
practice for as many times as possible in front of a mirror, and with others. Ernest Hemingway
once said that the first draft of anything is shit. I couldn't agree more. Practice makes perfect.
Perfection doesn't come easy. Second, don't put too many words on each slide. The most common
mistake a presenter can make is putting too much information on the screen and read from it. It
makes a presentation boring and predictable. Use fewer words is the way to go. Pictures help too,
they communicate so much better than letters.

老师让学生写 e-mail 问问题好呢还是在课堂上当面问好？
I think it's better to ask questions in person for the following reasons. First, one can learn so much
more from a conversation or discussion. Many of brilliant thoughts were only made possible
through having discussions and exchanging ideas. Both student and teacher are able to dig a little
deeper into the topic if they sit down and talk for a few minutes. The second reason would be:

instant feedback. Emails can take days to be answered, they aren't really that reliable. They end up
in spam folders or get buried up pretty quickly.

A school in your hometown is planning an after-school activity for their students. What advice
would you give to the school and why? Please include specific examples and details in your
explanation.
Personally speaking, I would recommend the school to set up some sports teams for their students
because it’s beneficial to students’ health and they can have the opportunity to learn to become a
team player. For example, when I was in high school, I practiced basketball with my team every
day after school. After one semester, I found myself healthier and stronger than my peers because
I had to exercise regularly and pay more attention to my diet. In addition, I learned how to
cooperate with other players in order to achieve our common goal, which can still be applied to
my work environment today. Therefore, team sports would be a great option for after-school
activities.

Some people enjoy spending their free time with their family members or friends. Others prefer
to spend their free time alone. Which do you prefer and why? Please use examples and reasons to
support your choice

Personally, I prefer to spend my free time alone because when I’m alone during my free time, I
can relax and go with the flow, and something fun always happens. For example, I had a four-day
vacation from work last week. During my vacation, I thought of something interesting to do every
morning and then just did it after breakfast. I didn’t have to worry about whether my friends or
family would like it or coordinating with their schedule. Also, because I was spontaneous all the
time, I came across a lot of new places and new people that I never had a chance to meet before.
Therefore, I prefer to be alone in my free time.
