  　　1.Art 2.Scientific research 3.Parks and public gardens
  　　What do you think is more important？

      I think parks and public gardens is more important when the government cuts the economic crisis.
      Firstly, funding for parks and public gardens provides an opportunity for people to engage in physical activities,
      which is considerably beneficial to health. Nowadays, due to the sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating diet,
      overweight and obesity are epidemic problems across the world. A primary focus of attention is providing the environment
      where people can be physically active.
      Admittedly, developing art and scientific research is important to the country. However, in the times of crisis,
      people usually lay emphasis on basic needs instead of spiritual needs. As a result, the importance of material
      comforts overweights that of nourishment for the mind.

　　2、Do you agree or disagree with the following statement？
      Taking care of pets brings important benefits to a child.

      I think that pet raising is beneficial to a child for the following reasons.
      Firstly, by taking care of pets, children would realise how to maintain the responsibility.
      He or she needs to commit a series of complicated duties, including learning about habitual
      nature of the pet, preparing for the suitable amount of food to feed it in time, doing the cleaning
      and even playing with it.
      Secondly, pet raising enables the children to experience the happiness of being devoted to others.
      Pets are very cute. Although pet raising can waste some time, it will provide the children with a sense
      of achievement. By playing with the pet, he or she can get a lot of fun.

　　3、Do you agree or disagree with the following statement？
      While parents have the responsibility to educate young people about healthy eating habits,
      schools should also be responsible for this.

      I think schools should also be responsible for educating young people about healthy eating habits for the
      following reasons.

      Firstly, most schools have the dining hall, which provides students with food. That's to say. Schools have the
      responsibility for reminding students of paying more attention to healthy eating habits.

      Secondly, schools can provide young people with more professional guidelines on how to foster healthy eating habits.
      Schools have the ability to do more research about health education. These guidelines are based on theory and practice.

　　4、Some people think it would help students to learn if teachers give time for discussion in class,
      others think that class discussion is unnecessary.
      What is your opinion and why.

      Personally, I would say the best way to learn is to participate in class discussion, to begin with, students need to do
      lots of search and prepare notes for the class discussion. They can learn a lot by actively preparing for this. Additionally,
      the whole class gets a chance to hear multiple points of view, although some points might not be as thought-provoking, you can
      learn a lot of stuff beyond the textbooks anyway, and understand how an idea works in real life when people share their personal
      experiences.

　　5、Do you agree or disagree？
      People in the past are more interested in improving their neighborhood (the area where they live) than now.
      Firstly, the limited spare time owned by the people today dampers their passion for improving the community. Nowadays, people have
      devoted most of their time to their work in order to stand out in the fierce competition.
      Secondly, The ties among members of the community become more estranged, which make people nowadays less interested in bettering the
      neighborhood. With the accelerating urbanization,  the population movement has become more frequent than ever before out of various purposes,
      job opportunity, higher education.

Which kind of extracurricular activity would you like to attend if you have a chance: writing essays for students’ newspaper, joining a hiking club or working in the dormitory discipline committee?
　　Personally, I would like to join a hiking club. First off, if I hike in the mountains, I can get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and escape from the concrete jungles, busy street and the crowd. I can get close to mother nature, so I can keep myself refreshed. At the same time, I get a chance to breath fresh air and enjoy the breeze out in the wild. Additionally, one can do other interesting activities outdoors, like go fishing, setting up a camp fire and stuff like that. Hiking club can help me to
   bond with friends and people who have the same interest and hobby.
