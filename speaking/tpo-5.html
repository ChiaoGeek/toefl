The women's problem is that she needs to write her history paper that is due the next day,
but the storm has knocked out the power in the city, she can't charge her laptop anymore.
The first solution is that she can go to the library in another city to do her work here.
The second is to ask the professor for an extension.
I think the first solution is better.
First of all, the library is only 20 minutes. It doesn't take her too much time to get there
to charge her computer. Secondly, the profession said that he won't give an any extension for
this assignment.

In the conversation, the woman's proplem is that she has to move out right away because the water
pipe in her appartment is broken.
There are two possible solutions.
The first solution is that she can stay at a friend's place. The second is to rent a room

get to 1.开始渐渐做某事 2.有机会做某事 3.表示努力设法做成某事
The man's problem is that there is a big comfilct in his course schedule. He has to take two required
courses to graduate but they are offered at the same time.
There are two possible solutions.
This first is to do an independent study on his Shakespeare course.
The second solution is to take it at another university.
I think the second solution is better.
First of all, it's mentioned in the conversation that the class being offered at the other university
is excellent, also, he can make many friends when he is over there. Secondly, in doing so, he still gets
to go to lectures for it and work with the professor and classmates in class, which is more productive.

The woman's problem is that her computer is broken and being repaired in the shop, now she can't finish all
the paper in time.
There are two possible solutions.
The first solution is that she can go to the computer lab to do all the work.
The second is waiting for her computer to be repaired.
I think the first solution is better.
Firstly, she won't waste anytime on the weekend, and there is no guaranty that the repair shop can get
her computer ready as early as the beginning of next week.
Secondly, she can choose a time when the lab is less noisy to do work, such as early in the morning or late in
the evening.

[We are not getting much studying done]
[joke around 开玩笑]
[By the time Friday afternoon rolls around 随着周五的来临]
[unwind 松开 解开]
[It’s hard to stay focused at the very end of the week.]
[although things have gotten so out of hand 尽管事情已经变得难以控制]
[it’s worth considering]
[just a second, 稍等一下 another possibility is]
[enormously 巨大的]
[agenda 议事日程]
[you stay focused on your goals]
The woman's problem is that her study group is not getting much studying done because they have all become good
friends and joke around a lot instead of studying.
There are two possible solutions.
The first is to change to another day.
The second solution is to appoint a leader to the group.
I think the first solution is better.
First of all, the presence of a leader can set an agenda and keep fouced on their goals.
Secondly, it's mentioned in the conversation that Friday afternoon is when everyone is free to meet, so changing the
meeting schedule would mess things up for many group members.

[wrist 手腕]
[sprain 扭伤]
[out of practice 疏于练习]
The woman's problem is that she needs to play the violin in a big concert, but her wrist was sprained.
There are two possible solutions.
The first is to try to play anyway.
The second solution is to get Jim to replace her and play in the concert.
I think the first is better.
Firstly, that way she won't let the other group members down, and her doctor said her wrist should be feeling
better by then.
Secondly, it's mentioned in the conversation that Jim is not reliable. If he's always late for the rehearsals,
that will compromise the whole performance. And that's unfair to the other group members who have been practicing
for weeks.

[I left my class schedule back at the dorm]
[be supposed to 被期望]
[If you were a lemon, you would not be supposed to dwell on the sweetness of watermelon.]
[dwell on 老是想着]

The man's problem is that he left his class schedule in his dorm and now he can't find the class.
There are two possible solutions.
The first is to go to the computer center and check his schedule on the computer.
The second solution is to check the three lecture halls on each floor till he finds the right one.
I think the first solution is better for the following reasons.
Firstly, if he looks up the schedule online, not only he can find where the class is, he can also get the schedule
for the rest of the day. Plus, it's really embarassing to stick his head into each lecture hall, ask if it's the right one
It will disturb the other professors and students as well.

tpo 3
The woman's problem is that she wants to attend an award ceremony and accept her award, but she’s got a biology exam that’s scheduled
at the same time.
There are two possible solutions.
The first is to skip the exam and write a five page paper instead.
Or she can find someone to receive the award for her.
I think the first solution is better.
First, she did mention in the conversation that she has plenty of ideas, and she’s confident she’ll be able to do a good job.
Also, if she does not attend the ceremony, her parents are going to be very disappointed because they can’t see her on stage.
