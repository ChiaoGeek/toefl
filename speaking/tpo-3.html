[lobby 大堂]
The student who wrote the letter is suggesting the school to display paintings and other artwork by
students at the entrance of the student center, because lots of people pass through, and it’s filled
with light.
In the conversation, the woman disagrees with the opinions stated in the letter.
First of all, she thinks that the student center is too crowded, it’s full of students moving around,
students can’t enjoy the artworks in the setting where people are walking in front of you, or blocking
the view.
The second reason is that the lighting in the student center is not ideal for showing artworks.
It’s too bright in there when sunny outside, too dark when it’s cloudy. She states that the artworks
should be displayed at somewhere there’s consistent light, which always stays at the same level.

The business studies department plans to require all students to intern at a local business, because they
can get more working experience and that will help when they are in job hunt after graduation.
In the conversation, the woman disagrees with the school’s plan.
First of all, she thinks students won’t learn anything valuable at these positions. They only get to do
some simple tasks such as typing and filing stuff, it’s a waste of time.
Second, many other universities in the city have the same requirement for students, so after they graduate,
the competition is still there. Getting a permanent job is almost impossible because there just aren’t enough
jobs available for all business graduates.

The school is planning to play classical music during lunch hour in the student cafeteria to give students a
chance to relax and encourage more face to face conversations between students.
In the conversation, the man disagrees with the school’s plan for the following reasons.
First of all, students aren’t looking for a relaxing time during the break, they are either busy preparing for
upcoming exams or working on assignments.
Second, most students don’t even like classical music. If the school played this kind of music, that will encourage
even more students to bring their MP3 players to school, therefore even fewer students will be talking to each other.
