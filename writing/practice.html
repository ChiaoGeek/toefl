1.Some people believe that taking field trips (e.g. going to the museum) is an important part of
children’s education. Others believe that it is better for children to study at school.

Recent decades have seen an increased awareness of educational development, where students can acquire
knowledge or skills, as well as learn to become a qualified citizen. There is a debate on whether taking
field trips is an important part of children's education. Some people hold the view that it is vital for
students to taking field trips, while other people view this issue from an opposite angle. However, I support
the former one.

To begin with, taking field trips contributes to stimulate children’s interest for studying.
Since the ways that children gain knowledge at school are single, they tend to feel bored and lost
the interest for studying. Take me for example. In my first year, I attended the course named Power
System that was very abstract and full of theoretical knowledge. At first, I did not have any interest
for the class because my teacher only teached us by the lectures we were hard to concentrate on.
However, in the middle of term, my teacher taked the whole class to visit the transformer substation near by
our university. When seeing the true transformer, I was all astonished by its structure and impatient
to make sense of its principal. It was visiting the transformer substation that aroused my interest for
this course. Therefore, taking field trips enables children to be interested in studying.

Furthermore, taking field trips can improve children’s learning efficiency.


Last but not the least, taking field trips can widen children’s vision, as well as
and the knowledge children gain only from learning textbooks are limited


2.Educating children is a more difficult tasktoday than it was in the past because they spend so much time on cellphone,online games and social networking websites.


3.Workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do
during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long.

Recent year, the society has an increased awareness of focusing on the sense of satisfaction of workers. Many companies try to improve
the sense of satisfaction of workers via various methods. Some people state that many different types of tasks can contribute  Workers
to be more satisfied. However, I think this view does not hold the water.

To begin with, various tasks require workers to face more chanllenges. It is not hard to imagine that different tasks need workers to
equip with different skills. Take programmer for example. The primary task of programmer is to develop all kinds of application by writing
code. A application consists of many components, such as frontend and backend, which requires the technological company to recruit different
type of crew. However, some companies also let programmer do other tasks apart from writing code. Therefore, thoes programmers need to spend
much time on learning new skills, which will ocuppy much time when they would have to relax. Compare with those programmers who only write
code, they often feel overwhelmed and unsatisfied.

Furthermore, similar tasks do not mean that a worker need to do repetitive tasks. For a given task, it usually requires people to do different
things. For teachers, they need not only to impart knowledge but also to manage students. Admittedly, they may impart the same knowledge for
different students. However, when they encount different students, they need to select different ways to teach students, which does not make
teachers feel dull.
