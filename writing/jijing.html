Do you agree or disagree with the statement: University students should be required to
take basic science classes even if they are not part of the field of the study.

There is no doubt that higher education is of great significance for one's future career. That's mainly because
the university can provide students with all kinds of courses. Some people think every student should take basic
science classes no matter what he or she majors in. While others hold the view that it is not necessary to spend
much time on the classes that are irrelevant to their majors. As for me, I support the first view for the following
reasons.

To begein with, taking more classes beyond major can widen one's view and enrich their knowledge.

Furthermore, taking basic science classes enables students to make sense of the world.

Admittedly, the limited spare time can hamper their passion for taking extra classes. For instanse,

the community most and why?1.a shopping mall 2.an art center 3.a hotel.

It's better than attending university straight away.

Nowadays, education has been the focus of discussion, which plays a more and more decisive role in the competition of comprehensive
national strength. In order to improve education quality, especially higher educaiton, people come up with a series of ways. Some people
hold the view that studnets should take at least one year to work or travel no matter what they major in. Personally speaking, I agree with
this opinion.

Firstly, taking a gap year to work before university enables students to gain more social experience, which is considerably beneficial to
their future careers.

Secondly, by traveling, students can experience various cultures.

Compared with attending university without a gap year, working and traveling contribute to assit students to stimulate their interests in
studying.

Finally, sports allows students to meet and make friends with a large arrange of people.

The best way for a teacher to help students become more interested in a subject is to explain that subject will be
useful in their lives outside the school.

Education has become one of the most hot issues drawing the attention of modern people especially those who consider to
promote the quality of schooling. Although the introduction of practical value of mastering a subject might be useful,
I believe that it could not be the best approach and there are other more effective ways to stimulate students' interests
in the subject.

Admittedly, by makeing sense of the practical value of acquiring the knowledge of certain subject, students are likely to
be interested in the subject. However,

Moreover, class presentation enables every student to participate in discussion, which encourages them to develop their
interests.

In addition, it is probably a more effective way for teachers to improve their teaching methods in order to attract their students
to learn.

If you are selecting a leader for a student organization, honesty is the most important to consider in deciding whom to vote for.

The student who is a leader for a student organization need to be equiped with a wide range of abilities. That is because that he or she
need  not only to make right decisions but also to manage the whole organization. Although honestry is of significance to being a leader,
I believe that honestry is not the most important and there are other more preferential abilities to be required in order to be a good
leader.

Admittedly, honesty is the indispensable requirement for a good leader. As the proverb goes, honesty is the best policy. Whoever you are,
you mush obey the rule of honesty. However,

Moreover, how to cooperate with other classmates is also worth noticing.

In addition, organizing skill is probably a more important quility for students to vote for a leader.

Do you agree or disagree with the statement: The way a person is dressed in is a good indication of his or her personality.

There are many ways to learn about the personality of a person such as books he read and friends he has. Some people assert that
we can also learn about a person through his style of clothing. However, I disagree with that opinion.

Admittedly, for many people, the clothes they wear can reflect their personalities, espeically for adults. This is because most adults
have their own tastes and they can usually independently choose their own dressing style, which shows their tastes and personality.

However, sometimes we can not learn about a person by his or her dressing, especially when we face a child. This is because small children
usually do not have the freedom to choose their own clothes. Instead, their parents always help them choose clothes because their parents
know what best suits their children.
