Do you agree or disagree with the statement: University students should be required to
take basic science classes even if they are not part of the field of the study.

There is no doubt that higher education is of great significance for one's future career. That's mainly because
the university can provide students with all kinds of courses. Some people think every student should take basic
science classes no matter what he or she majors in. While others hold the view that it is not necessary to spend
much time on the classes that are irrelevant to their majors. As for me, I support the first view for the following
reasons.

To begein with, taking more classes beyond major can widen one's view and enrich their knowledge.

Furthermore, taking basic science classes enables students to make sense of the world.

Admittedly, the limited spare time can hamper their passion for taking extra classes. For instanse,

the community most and why?1.a shopping mall 2.an art center 3.a hotel.

There are a large number of ways to improve the community such as builing public active areas, constructing cultural center,
and developing the economy. As far as I am concerned, I hold the view that building a shopping mall is the best way to
better the community.

Firstly, shopping mall can provide members of the comnunity with direct convenience.

What's more, shopping mall will bring the community more job opportunities.

Compared with building shopping mall, art center and hotel are less beneficial to the community.

People's views on what can contibute to be happy vary from person to person. Some people think they can gain more happiness from job.
While others hold the view that their happiness largely hinges on living enviroment. As for me, job can provide me with more happiness.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: After high school, students should have at least one year to work or travel.
It's better than attending university straight away.

Nowadays, education has been the focus of discussion, which plays a more and more decisive role in the competition of comprehensive
national strength. In order to improve education quality, especially higher educaiton, people come up with a series of ways. Some people
hold the view that studnets should take at least one year to work or travel no matter what they major in. Personally speaking, I agree with
this opinion.

Firstly, taking a gap year to work before university enables students to gain more social experience, which is considerably beneficial to
their future careers.

Secondly, by traveling, students can experience various cultures.

Compared with attending university without a gap year, working and traveling contribute to assit students to stimulate their interests in
studying.

Which way do you think is the best for a student to make new friends: A. joining a sports team, B. participating in
community activities, C. traveling.

As the saying goes, a father is a treasure, a brother is a comfort, a friend is both. That is to say, friends are of great significance
to one's life. There are a wide range of ways to enlarge our social network, such as joining a sports team, participating in
community activities, and traveling. As for me, I think joining a sports team is the best choice.

First and foremost, everyone in sports team has the same hobby, which is the most fundamentle character for friends.

In the second place, joing a sports team will provide long period of time for students to get along with each other.

Finally, sports allows students to meet and make friends with a large arrange of people.

If your friend did something you don't like things, do you still want to continue the friendship with him?

Friendship and friend continue to be the center of our life. The relationship we share with our friends is grounded in
mutual care as our friends help us to shape our personalities as well. Therefore, we should try my best to continue the
friendship with friends instead of giving up easily even if he or she did what we don't like.

First and foremost, friends are precious and of great signicance to a person. Therefore, we need to manage to maintian and
improve the relationship among our friends. As Franklin said, a father is a treasure; a brother is a comfort; a friend is both.

The issue about how to become successful has been the focus of discussion. Although, the definition of success varies from
person to person, I hold the view that success mainly hinges on job promotion, good socail networking, and enriched experience.
There are a wide range of ways to realise success. However, acquiring more than one skill is more beneficial to success than
people who just concentrate on one skill.

Fisrt and foremost, by learning more than one skills, people can gain more job opportunities and be more easier to acquire
job promotion.

In the second place, acquiring many skills enables people to enlarge their social networking.

The best way for a teacher to help students become more interested in a subject is to explain that subject will be
useful in their lives outside the school.

Education has become one of the most hot issues drawing the attention of modern people especially those who consider to
promote the quality of schooling. Although the introduction of practical value of mastering a subject might be useful,
I believe that it could not be the best approach and there are other more effective ways to stimulate students' interests
in the subject.

Admittedly, by makeing sense of the practical value of acquiring the knowledge of certain subject, students are likely to
be interested in the subject. However,

Moreover, class presentation enables every student to participate in discussion, which encourages them to develop their
interests.

In addition, it is probably a more effective way for teachers to improve their teaching methods in order to attract their students
to learn.

If you are selecting a leader for a student organization, honesty is the most important to consider in deciding whom to vote for.

The student who is a leader for a student organization need to be equiped with a wide range of abilities. That is because that he or she
need  not only to make right decisions but also to manage the whole organization. Although honestry is of significance to being a leader,
I believe that honestry is not the most important and there are other more preferential abilities to be required in order to be a good
leader.

Admittedly, honesty is the indispensable requirement for a good leader. As the proverb goes, honesty is the best policy. Whoever you are,
you mush obey the rule of honesty. However,

Moreover, how to cooperate with other classmates is also worth noticing.

In addition, organizing skill is probably a more important quility for students to vote for a leader.

Do you agree or disagree with the statement: The way a person is dressed in is a good indication of his or her personality.

There are many ways to learn about the personality of a person such as books he read and friends he has. Some people assert that
we can also learn about a person through his style of clothing. However, I disagree with that opinion.

Admittedly, for many people, the clothes they wear can reflect their personalities, espeically for adults. This is because most adults
have their own tastes and they can usually independently choose their own dressing style, which shows their tastes and personality.

However, sometimes we can not learn about a person by his or her dressing, especially when we face a child. This is because small children
usually do not have the freedom to choose their own clothes. Instead, their parents always help them choose clothes because their parents
know what best suits their children.

or many years, research has shown that doing exercises helps to alleviate a number of health
complications, leading to a healthy body, soul and mind. However, some people use all excuses to
justify reasons as to why they lead a sedentary life. This essay seeks to look at benefits of physical
activities as opposed to reading a book or watching television.

Doing exercises offers many benefits to one’s physiological processes. As opposed to watching
television or reading a book where energy expenditure is low，physical exercises aid in efficient
blood flow and cardiovascular fitness. On the contrary, lack of exercises often leads to a number
of health problems such as high blood pressure, heart diseases and obesity. To be able to truly
relax one must possess a healthy body, and this has to be achieved by healthier activities like
jogging, fitness training, or mountain climbing, rather than sitting in a chair all day long.
Moreover, exercises help people utilize their leisure time more constructively. People gain motor
skills and other relevant traits like strength, flexibility and coordination. On the other hand, some
books and programs on television end up making the viewers imitate bad habits which they see
from the actors or read in the books. Since these groups of people lack time to release their stress,
the chances of them developing bad habits is very high compared to those who engage in sports,
games and exercises.

Finally, some forms of exercises encourage socialization and team building, which is a much
greater way to relax than being alone. Examples of these exercises include many of the collective
sports people often do such as soccer and basketball. In these sports, people meet and play as a
team, share their happiness and excitement with each other and as a result achieve much higher
levels of enjoyment and satisfaction. By contrast, watching TV or reading a book is often solitary
experience, involving little interaction with others, which is boring.
In a nutshell, doing exercises is much more beneficial than watching television or reading a book.
Our bodies require regular exercises to make us remain active and healthy. A fit person is more
productive in the workplace since he/she can effectively accomplish responsibilities, and can also
be more relaxed after work because he/she is more actively involved with the nature or other
people around him/her.

Friends are those people who are making our life vivid and more meaningful. What is the best way
for a student to make new friends?
a. participating in sport team
b. volunteering for community service
c. traveling

[
Initially, by joining the community activities, students can share the same destination with team
members. With the concept of “community” prevailing in our modern society, more and more
communities seek for new residents who can help out other people who live in the same
neighborhood, such as caring for the elderly, recycling, guarding young kids after school while
parents are away. In order to fulfill the duty assigned, all the participants need to share the work.
By working together for the same goal, they talk to each other, share opinions in making things
better and they aid each other to make the community work more sound and complete. For
students, they quickly know those people in the group and become new friends

 Do you agree or disagree with the statement that the rules in societies today are too strict for
young people?

Each era has its social background in terms of rules exerted on youngsters. Are societies today
really issuing more rules on young people nowadays? To me, I do not think so. Rules are not too
strict for young people living today within society.
Initially, due to globalization, people are accepting of the norm. To be more exact, the societies are
looser on youngsters in many aspects, in the past, young people needed to wear uniforms and kept
“student hairstyles” in schools. Now, students can dress up freely and have their hairstyles as they
see fit. In the past, there were few majors they could choose in college; at present, there are
hundreds, if not thousands, of majors they can choose their discretion. Society does not pressure
them to take, for example, law, medicine or economics as the only promising majors; instead, they
can do this totally out of their interests as majoring in tourism, cooking or even physical
education.
In the past, if young people spent too much money on food or clothes, they were called a
“spendthrift.” However, now, the society would think that today's youngsters are simply enjoying
their life and this might be conducive to their future challenges. They are not given specific rules
for what to do. Young people, thus, are not under too many strict rules in this modern time.

Secondly, the concept of creativity is highly encouraged to not just think, but to act out in the
society. “Think outside the box” is one of the most famous slogans in our time. Examples can be
seen from SAT exams or GRE exams focusing on insightful ideas, perspectives in reply to the
prompt. In business, headhunters look for people who can contribute “minds” rather than “labor.”
Those are all signs of not putting too many rules on young people but being freer in those aspects.
Conversely, in the past, youngsters were in the habit of giving the same answers textbooks said or
engaging in the business their parents did or hoped. It was not so multi-cultured and maybe, they
did not think living abroad or even to marry foreigners were decent things to do.
Admittedly, some people must think that today's society gives more rules and is stricter to young
people, such as the fact that we are living in a more competitive world where youngsters are
required to study harder or to focus only on their academic studies for better competitiveness.
Some young people are even forced to learn music, social dances or golf to become outstanding
modern young elite. I，yet still, do not think so as present youngsters are not under strict rules by
society in that they are more accepting of the individuality and they are highly encouraged to be
creative as the points mentioned above.

Nowadays, when people are enjoying the rich fruits bought by economic development, meanwhile, unhealthy lifestyle,
work pressure, competitive pressure etc are eroding their health. Doing exercise is of vital
significance for a person to improve their health. However, there is a debate on what kind of sports are more
beneficial to people. Some people hold the view that doing exercise alone is more convenient, while others
argue that doing exercise with a group of people will have more benefits. As for me, I support the latter.

First of all, compared with exercising alone, joining sport teams can provide people with more choices of sporting
events. 

What's more, doing exercise with a group of people enables you to escape from sluggishness
by means of supervising each other.

Lastly, by exercising with others, people gain more fun and more networking opportunities.

As the improvement of people's living standard, the quality of life is regarded as the growing concern. People's views
on the disadvantages of advantages of living big city or village vary from person to person. As for me, although living
in small towns has great advantages, I prefer to live in a big city for many personal concern.

Firstly, by living in the city, people can have an opportunity to access to more educational resources than small towns.

Secondly, living in the city enables me to enjoy the convenience of modern life.

Thirdly, there are more job opportunities in the city than village, which is beneficial to my future career.

4.A good leader should be open-minded to others’ ideas and willing to change his mind.
Some people believe that leaders should have strong opinions and should not change them even others disagree with
them because it is a strong way to show a strong leadership. However, in today's workplace, it is of vital importance
for a leader to create an <b>democratic</b> working atmosphere. Therefore, sometimes a leader should provide his or her
team members with opportunities to express their opinions. If necessary, a leader should change his or her opinions as well.

To begin with, a leader primary task is to stimulate and motivate his or her colleagues to come up with creative ideas, which
benefits teamwork to a large extent.

Moreover, it is possible that a leader's decision could be wrong and will exert negative influence on teams' work.
As everyone knows, no one is perfect and people do make mistakes.

职业、政治
5.Do you agree or disagree with the statement: Many people think that athletes or celebrities that are from the entertainment
business can change their careers to be politicians. Do you agree or disagree with this idea of profession change?

Some people believe that it is ridiculous that athletes or celebrities choose to change thier careers to be politicians because of
lacking professional knowledge about politics. However, in current society, everyone has an opportunity to pursuit their own career.
It is possible that one can engage in two or more different or irrelevent jobs. Thus, whoever the person is, an athlete, or a
celebrities, as long as they desire to divert their fileds, they can success with career changes.

Firstly, compared with ordinary people, athletes and celebrities can better tackle with pressure.

Secondly,

Admittedly, athletes or celebrities might not be equipped with professional knowledge about politics. That's because they devote
themself to diong physical excercise or performance. However, in current society, they can have opportunities to study those professional
knowledge once they decided to change their careers to be politicians. For example,

Firstly, athletes or celebrities who change their careers to be politicians can contribute to the development of their country's
sports and arts.

Secondly, athletes or celebrities have the rallying point very much because of celebrity effect.

Admittedly, athletes or celebrities might not be equipped with professional knowledge about politics. That's because they devote

social networking. With the development of technoloies, there are so many ways to communicate with others such as through social media
or with text messages. Some people hold the view that people should not spend a great deal of time on communicating by technologies.
However, I disagree with this point of view for the following reasons.

First of all, by technologies, people can have effective communication without going out, which will save much more time.

Secondly, communicating by technologies enables people to avide embarrassment during the conversation.

Admittedly, talking face to face has some advantages. For example, people can better understand facial expression, which is aslo
of great significnace for people to enhance the effciency of communication. What's more,
However,

As the saying goes, a near neighbor is better than a distant cousin. The concept of "neighborhood" has been a great issue in the
past since it refers to the place where people share the same space for living. When time goes by, this concept has somewhat changed.
Nowadays, fewer people pay attention to the improve the neighborhood for many reasons. Thereby, I disagree with this view.

Firstly, morden lifestyle takes up much time of a person, which causes that he or she does not have enough energy to improve
neighborhood.
