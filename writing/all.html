定义/概念：The reading passage gives the definition/concept of….
关系/现象/问题/功能/原因/过程/结果/功能：The reading passage describes the
relationship between … and …/phenomenon / the problem/ the process /some
functions/some features of ….
XXX is…… (一句话概括 reading 的内容)
In the lecture, the professor explains it with a(n)/some research (es)/example(s).
This first is that …… (最后一句注意挂钩)
The second is that …… (同样挂钩)


1. 一般来讲囊括四段，一个开头段和三个body（不需要结尾！结尾比较鸡肋）

2. 在开头段的第一句里，宝宝们应该点明reading和 listening 的关系(for? Against? 大部分时候是against)
  E.g The reading and writing has a conflict over/regarding the topic that...
  The reading and writing share a common ground over the topic...

接着，应该清晰地陈述reading 和 listening 双方所站的立场
  e.g. The reading believes/considers/is in favor that/of...
     While/however/but/whereas the listening ...

在开头段的最后summarize一下listening against(for)的几个小点
   E.g the listening supports its/her/his claim, giving three reasons:...

3. 后面的三个body段宝宝们就可以“机械化生产”了，一般来讲我的套路都是：
  First of all,the reading......(短小精悍一句概括). However, the listening disagrees/believes that it is not the case/.../. （接着写上听力中给到的证据）

综合模板中的注意事项

综合写作总的来讲还是比较简单的，毕竟给了reading。但是宝宝们也不要因为给了reading就掉以轻心，觉得即使我listening听不懂也可以投机取巧蒙一些出来。
笔者不排除听力基本没懂但是依旧考的很好的情况，但是作为广大考生，赚小便宜的心理还是要不得，长期处在这样的自我满足阶段很容易让你一直瓶颈，没有进步！

关于综合写作的字数问题，笔者表示也并不能很了解，因为笔者第一次写到了300左右，第二次写到了350，但两次都是29，所以无法评判。但是笔者个人感觉，
把听力的方方面面都囊括到，没有废话，基本都可以320+

一、单词做插入语：
　　Apparently/indisputably/certainly/indeed等
　　还以Middle agers 来举例：Let’s get down to fundamentals and agree that middle agers are lumbered with the enormous family expenditure, for whom money is the panacea to ease the pressure.
　　我们随便挑一个放在句子里，就可以了，比如Let’s get down to fundamentals and agree that, apparently, middle agers are lumbered with the enormous family expenditure, for whom money is the panacea to ease the pressure.
　　二、短语做插入语
　　More often than not/every so often/ more or less/to be frank/ without doubt 等
　　还以上文例子展开Let’s get down to fundamentals and agree that, apparently, middle agers, more often than not, are lumbered with the enormous family expenditure, for whom, without doubt, money is the panacea to ease the pressure.
