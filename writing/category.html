Also it gives you a glimpse into other exotic cultures, you can get to know different customs and way of living of the people that you are not very familiar with, and that makes you more creative and imaginative.

//////Field trip:

   　　通过探索学习更有趣和有效：learning through exploration is more fun and effective .

   　　我认为学习最好的方法是去实地考察,实际上, 我还记得我小学的时候参加的实地考察。我们去了动物园,跟看视频不一样, 在动物园管理员的指令下我有机会与动物互动,他们是如此可爱。我想说的是,学生可以发现一些在图片或视频,甚至在教室里发现不了的东西。除此之外,通过探索学习更多有趣和有效。对于一些学生来说，阅读教科书是件很难的事情,但是,去实地考察,他们就非常感兴趣,因此他们更好的集中精力,所以学习更多的知识。

   　　I would say the best way learn is to go on a field trip, and actually I still remember my field trip back in primary school. We went to the zoo, not like watching a video, I got a chance to interact with animals under the instruction of the zoo keeper, they were so lovely. What I am trying to say is that students can discovery stuff that doesn't come across in pictures or videos or even in a classroom. Apart from that, learning through exploration is more fun and effective. There are students who got a hard time reading textbooks, however, going on a field trip, they are totally interested in the stuff they are going to see, thus they concentrate better and can learn more.

///////Presentation

   　　需要公众演讲技能的工作：

   　　政治家、记者、商人：politician, journalist, businessmen;

   　　需要社交能力的场合：

   　　give a speech at a wedding, share your thoughts at a meeting, showcase your product as a product manager, attend a pitch meeting in order to close a deal, attend Toastmasters meetings;

   　　【段子】

   　　就我个人而言,我认为做一个演示让学生受益更多。首先,做演示可以帮助一个人能够清楚地沟通,这是非常重要的, 甚至是对于一个学生来说,当他或她可能会有一个问题,他们渴望从老师那里得到一个答案,所以他们需要清楚地表达自己。

   　　Personally, I think doing a presentation benefit the students more. To begin with, doing presentations can help a person to be able to communicate clearly, and that is even very important for a student, when he or she might have a question and they are eager to get an answer from the teacher, and they need express themselves clearly.

   　　实际上,我们的教育未能提供给学生们在现实世界中生存所需要与演讲技巧。想想看,很多时候你需要在公共场合发表演讲,比如婚在礼上发表演讲, 在一次会议上分享你的想法的, 作为一个产品经理你需要展示你的产品,参加一个商务会谈(达成一笔交易),参加宴会,等等。为了掌握这一技能，我们需要在学校做大量的演讲,在未来这肯定会帮助你。

   　　Actually, our education fails to provide with the presentation skills that students need to survive in the real world. Think about it, there are lots of occasions when you need to handle a speech in a public setting, like give a speech at a wedding, share your thoughts at a academic meeting, showcase your product as a product manager, attend a pitch meeting in order to close a deal, attend Toastmasters meetings, so on and so forth. One definitely need to do lots of presentations during school in order to master this skills, and this will definitely help you in the future.
