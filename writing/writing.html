<pre>1. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?   At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as   classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons   and examples to support your answer.The development of higher education has been the center of public discussion. Especially, what kind of constructionshould be carried out in the university or college. Some people think educational institutions should pay more moneyfor the building of classes and libraries. However, others hold the view that sports and social activities arethe same important with classes and libraries and receive equal financial support. As for me, I support the secondview for the following reasons.First of all, compared to classes and libraries, students can gain other benefits which are also relevant to students' future career. For example, by doing sports, students can develop their team spirits. As we all known, currently, no taskcan be done by a single person. By participating in social activities, students can not only extend their social circle butalso enrich their social knowledge, which will make them easier to suit for the society when they graduate from universityor college.Secondly,  whether a university or college is well developed is determined by not only its academic achievement but also its socialinfluence. One the one hand, sports can make a university or college well-known. Take XXX university for example. Comparing withTsing university, XXX University may not be better than Tsing university in most academic fields. However, XXX University hasthe strongest basketball team, which can make it well-known. On the other hand, social activities would foster the human-culturaland social environment where the university can receive a lot of funds from its alumni.Admitted, a university or college need to put adequte money into classes and libraries. After all, teaching students professional skillsis the basic function for a university or college. However, education also play more important role in cultivating students in other aspects.In other words, students who only are specilized in academic field without other abillities can not perform well in the society. Therefor,the university or college should give equal focus.2.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?   It is more important to keep your old friends than it is to make new friends. Use specific reasons and examples   to support your answer.   As the saying goes, a father is a treasure, a bother is s comfort, but a friend is both. It is obvious that friends are important to   one's life. About how to deal with the relationship among the friends, different people have different views. Some peole think keeping   old friends is more important than making new friends. However, other people hold the view that making new friends should be consider   more. As far as I am concerned, I stand by the later.   Firstly, making new friends enable us to enlarge social circle. A good social circle can have an positive influence on our development.   Nowadays, a lot of things need help from other people.   help each other out   Secondly, by meeting new friends, we can know about more knowledge in different areas. help us to be more knowledgeable   Admittedly, we also need keep in touch with our old friends.4.

When it comes to the availability of educational resources, some believe that it is more difficult for kids from common household to get decent education due to the wide gap between rich and poor and the ever-increasing tuitions, while others claim that it is much easier for people to have access to different educational resources than ever before. I, personally, tend to argue that multiple educational resources are more accessible to modern people based on the following reasons.First off, the advent of technological gadgets makes it possible for people from common family backgrounds to gain access to education. To be more specific, with the appearance of smart phones, tablets and computer laptops, it is easier for people of all age groups, including adolescents and teenagers, to get access to all kinds of education resources. For example, with internet access and a laptop, which is basically a necessity for everyone, people of all age groups can get proper education especially with the establishment of massive on-line open course like courser, Edx, etc. These massive on-line courses covers a wide range of topics ranging from computer science, coding, to language learning and soft skill development. In sharp contrast, a few decades ago, people from poverty-stricken areas had never dreamed of attending the lectures offered by world-renowned professors, however, with the above-mentioned resources, it is absolutely possible for those people to realize their dreams. Thus, state-of-the-art technology makes if possible for people to have full access to high quality educational resources.Additionally, governments have put so much financial and human resources to provide education at different levels so that people enjoy a better chance to be educated. For instance, Chinese government spared no effort in this regard since education from kindergarten to twelfth grade is fully subsidized and such educational experience is accessible to children from both rural and urban areas. Besides, institutions of higher learning and various research centers receive state fund, and the figure is so phenomenal that it is not exaggerated to claim that it is in billions of U.S. dollars. Such foundations can be for multiple purpose, like purchasing advanced science equipment, attracting bring young researchers and scientists, funding cutting-edge research to improve people's livelihood, directly and indirectly. All of these institutions and universities are in a better position to provide education resources to people.In conclusion, it is much easier for people to get education of all level ranging from kindergarten to tertiary education since education comes in handy with advanced technological tools like these massive on-line courses and governments' effort to improve people's educational experience.</pre>
